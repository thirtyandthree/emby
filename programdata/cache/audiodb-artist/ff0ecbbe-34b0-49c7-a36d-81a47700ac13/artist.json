She has sold over 10 million copies of her albums during the span of her career thus far.  Stefanie Sun has an older sister three years her senior called Sng Yee-kia (simplified Chinese: \u5b59\u71d5\u4f73; traditional Chinese: \u5b6b\u71d5\u4f73; pinyin: S\u016bn Y\u00e0nji\u0101), and a younger sister six years her junior named Sng Ee-mei (simplified Chinese: \u5b59\u71d5\u7f8e; traditional Chinese: \u5b6b\u71d5\u7f8e; pinyin: S\u016bn Y\u00e0nm\u011bi).  Sun received her education at St Margaret's Secondary School, Raffles Girls' School and went on to attend St Andrew's Junior College She later attended university at Nanyang Technological University and attained a degree in Marketing. Her abilities were discovered by her music teacher, Lee Weisong at his music school. Sun made her first musical breakthrough in June 2000, following the release of her self-titled first album, Sun Yan Zi (\u5b6b\u71d5\u59ff) under Warner Music.  Stefanie's saccharine vocals and sincere personality have won the hearts of many, and her grounding as one of the most accomplished local artists in her native Singapore is firm. To date, she has won many awards, most notably at the Taiwan Golden Melody Awards, beating established singers, Jay Chou and Jolin Tsai. Among her followers, Sun has inspired and stirred other Singaporean artists (such as JJ Lin and Huang Yi Da) to expand overseas.  Sun does most of her recording, and conducts publicity events mainly in Taiwan, which comprises the majority of her fanbase. She also visits China, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore frequently for promotional rounds where she is warmly received.  Most of her songs are sung in Mandarin, with several in English. In her first album, she sings Tori Amos's \"Silent all These Years\". Sun's ability to speak various languages is reflected in the songs she sings. In the song \u5929\u9ed1\u9ed1, (Dark skies) she sings in both Mandarin and her native Teochew. It is an adaptation of a traditional Teochew folksong which included the first six words in the original Teochew - \"Thi-o\u00b7-o\u00b7, beh lo?h-h\u014d\u00b7\" - in the chorus.  She has won over 33 awards and other accolades for her music in the course of her career in Singapore, Taiwan, mainland China and Hong Kong (as well as at the pan-Asian MTV Asia Awards).  Yanzi sings Singapore's National Day Parade song, \"One United People\". In 2002 and 2003 Sun also sang the official theme songs for Singapore's National Day Parade: \"We Will Get There\" (\u4e00\u8d77\u8d70\u5230) and \"One United People\" (\u5168\u5fc3\u5168\u610f).  Sun is continually extending her influence in the Asian music industry. Sun collaborated with Mai Kuraki, a Japanese singer, on the last track of her To Be Continued... album. They collaborated yet again in 2003, this time on Mai Kuraki's If I Believe, released in July of 2003.  In late 2003, she decided to take a one year hiatus from making music, returning in late 2004 with a new album titled \"Stefanie\", intended to be a mirror of her debut album (self-titled as well, but in Chinese). This was to symbolise her return with a newcomer's attitude. She also started her own company, Make Music, during this sabbatical.  A Perfect Day was released on 2005, almost one year after the previous album Stefanie. She collaborated with some of the best musicians from Taiwan, namely MayDay (\u4e94\u6708\u5929) and F.I.R. in the song, 'First Day'.  Reviews of this new album has been mixed because of rumors in sales. But Stefanie had mentioned before that her priority is to make quality music, instead of over-commercialized products that sell well but have a lower level of artistic quality.  In 2006, Sun is in the midst of a regional concert tour. She has staged four full-house concerts at the renowned Hong Kong Colosseum. The performances have received rave reviews from the media as well as overwhelming support from fans. Sun also returned to Singapore in a much anticipated homecoming concert.
