She rose to prominence after her third-place performance in the 2005 season of the Super Girl contest, a national all-female singing competition in the People's Republic of China. Throughout the competition, she sang in English, Spanish and Cantonese in addition to Mandarin Chinese. She is particularly known for her signature whistle register.  Zhang's debut album was titled The One and was produced by Craig Williams. Her next album, Update, broke away from the Chinese pop scene by combining elements of R&B and jazz. After the release of Update, Zhang participated in a World Peace One concert that was designed to increase awareness and activism for world peace, and to raise funds for humanitarian relief. Other participating artists included U2, Madonna, Pink Floyd and Green Day.  Her father was an engine attendant for a transportation company in Chengdu, and her mother was a shop assistant.During her childhood, she performed at her parents' workplace on several occasions. However, her parents divorced when she was 13; two years later, Zhang's father died. This forced her to work outside of school; she started to sing at a local public house, where her uncle played the accompaniments.While performing at the pub, Zhang was exposed to a wide variety of music genres, and developed a taste for American country singers in addition to Western pop singers, such as Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera. Because she was unable to afford her own music players, Zhang frequently borrowed walkmans and headphones from her classmates, and skipped lunches to save enough money for cassettes.After graduating from college, she studied at Sichuan University's Foreign Language Department where she was majoring in English; she dropped out soon after to compete in the 2005 Super Girl competition.  Zhang auditioned for the Super Girl contest in 2005. Super Girl (simplified Chinese: \u8d85\u7ea7\u5973\u58f0; traditional Chinese: \u8d85\u7d1a\u5973\u8072) is the Chinese equivalent to the popular Idol franchise where only female contestants were allowed to participate.She auditioned in Chengdu, and after progressing through the preliminary rounds, she entered the national competition with Li Yuchun and He Jie (simplified Chinese: \u4f55\u6d01; traditional Chinese: \u4f55\u6f54).  Throughout the series, she had established a fan base whose members called themselves \"Liang Fen\" (simplified Chinese: \u51c9\u7c89), a phrase that combined the Chinese pronunciation of her name and the English word \"fan.\" The term \"Liang Fen\" originated from Hong Kong years ago, but is now used to define a particular type of bean jelly snack in central China.Zhang demonstrated her ability to sing in foreign languages, with performances of \"I Still Believe,\"\"What's Up,\"\"Beautiful,\"and \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina.\"As such, she was recognized by judges, critics and musicians to be the most talented singer in this competition.Some critics even regarded her as one of China's best artists.Nevertheless, she was not the most popular contestant among young supporters. Her final number of votes by text messaging was 1.3 million. Consequently, she placed third behind Li Yuchun and Zhou Bichang.Her loss did not come as a shock because Li and Zhou had garnered more popularity during the competition. Their creative eccentricity and tomboyish appearances triumphed over Zhang's \"old, introverted,  pretty-girl\" image.  After the competition ended, Zhang was invited to visit Sichuan University, her alma mater, during its orientation week celebration in early September. She performed her own rendition of Shania Twain's \"Any Man of Mine\" there.On September 26, 2005, she became the first Super Girl contestant to hold a personal music show for her fans. Numerous celebrities attended the show, including Huang Jianxiang, a host on CCTV's football shows, Phoenix TV host Zeng Zimo, and Taiwanese singer Sky Wu.Zhang also signed a contract with CCTV to play the supporting role in The Song of the Movie, a stage music show produced by Taiwan pop musician Jonathan Lee. Harlem Yu and Yuan Quan also starred in the musical, which opened in Beijing in December 2005 and later in Hong Kong.  On January 9, 2006, her first EP, Jane\u00b7Love (simplified Chinese: Jane\u00b7\u7231; traditional Chinese: Jane\u00b7\u611b) was released. The EP, which cost 2 million yuan to produce,contains six tracks in total: 3 songs and 3 instrumentals. In China alone, over 210,000 copies of the EP have been sold.On Forbes' China Celebrity 100 list, Zhang was placed 55th.Her debut album, The One, was released on October 11, 2006, her 22nd birthday.During the production of the album, Zhang visited the United States to collaborate with music producers Craig Williamsand Peter Hyams, the latter of whom had worked with Celine Dion and R.
