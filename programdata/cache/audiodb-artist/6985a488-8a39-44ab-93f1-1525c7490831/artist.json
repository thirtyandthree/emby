After winning the contest, he signed  with the Taiwanese record label, HIM International Music along with three other fellow contestants, Judy Chou (\u5468\u5b9a\u7def), Peter Pan (\u6f58\u88d5\u6587), Stanly Hsu (\u8a31\u4ec1\u6770).\n\nMusically, Lin is famous for his highly distinctive vocals, wide vocal range, and dreamy tone. His versatility and ability to sing from a wide range of music, from mandopop to jazz to indie-rock, differentiates him from his contemporary counterparts. \n\nImmediately after winning the competition, Lin, along with the top 10 contestants of One Million Stars, released two compilation albums. On June 3, 2008, Lin released his debut album titled \u795e\u79d8\u5609\u8cd3 (Mystery Guest). \n\nIn 2009, Lin released his 2nd album \u611f\u5b98/\u4e16\u754c (Senses All Around). The conceptive album was nicely received from the music critics. The more rock-based third album, \u7f8e\u5999\u751f\u6d3b (Perfect Life, 2011), was a more matured and diverse album, making Lin a distinct singer and performer in the pop music scene in Taiwan. In June 2012, Yoga Lin released his 4th studio album, \u5927\u5c0f\u8aaa\u5bb6.\n\n\u9673\u5955\u8fc5 (Eason Chan) and \u9673\u7dba\u8c9e (Cheer Chen) are the two of the many Mandopop singers that Lin admires the most.
